Foundations Project: Rock Paper Scissors

01/26/2022
This is our first project using Javascript. This is a basic game of rock, paper, scissors using JS functions, conditions, and a loop. The user is prompted to input rock, paper, or scissors. 5 rounds are plays, so the user will
be prompted 5 times.

Messages are logged to the console.
